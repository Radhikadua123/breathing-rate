# breathing-rate
This is a matlab code implemented on the eulerian video magnification which observes the subtle movement in the chest portion and finds the breathing rate by magnifying the region of interest by 30-40 times.
To run the code you just need matlab. Run the code by running the file "breathcount.m"
